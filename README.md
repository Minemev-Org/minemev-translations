# Minemev Translations

This directory contains the translation files for the website. Each file includes multiple language sections.

## Structure

- The `base` section contains the reference text for generating the website. **DO NOT edit the `base` section** unless you fully understand its purpose.
- Language sections like `en`, `es`, `zh-hans`, etc. contain the translated strings for each language.
- If a section for a language is empty, it means the translations are missing for that language. dont worry, it will grab the base if that key is not on the languaje

## How to Use

1. Only modify the sections related to the language you're translating (e.g., `es`, `fr`).
2. **Do not touch the `base` section** as it serves as the master reference for the website.
3. If you're unsure, consult the team before making changes.
